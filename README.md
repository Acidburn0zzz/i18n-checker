# W3C's i18n Checker 

This checker performs various tests on a Web Page to determine its level of internationalisation-friendliness. It also summarises key internationalization information about a page, such as character encoding and language declarations, etc.

The checker is also integrated into Unicorn.

Tests run by the version of the checker in development (ie. the code in this github repository) are documented at https://www.w3.org/International/quicktips/doc/checker.
